## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the following common tasks:

1. **Create Jenkinsfile:**
   - Make sure that a `Jenkinsfile` is present in each branch of the repository. This file is used by the Jenkins server to define the pipeline steps.

2. **Configure Jenkins Multibranch Task:**
   - Create a Multibranch Task in Jenkins and connect it with your GitHub repository. This is necessary for Jenkins to monitor and build branches as needed.

3. **Scan for Changes:**
   - Changes made to your branch in the GitHub repository should be automatically scanned by Jenkins. You can use the polling method of Jenkins to achieve this.

4. **Jenkins Pipeline Configuration:**
   - Ensure that your Jenkins server is correctly configured to respond to changes in your repository and execute the Jenkins pipeline defined in the Jenkinsfile.

## Execution Steps

Follow these steps to execute the Jenkins pipeline and run the services mentioned in the Docker Compose file:

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - If your project uses a virtual environment, activate it. This may not be necessary for all projects.

2. **Run the Jenkins Pipeline:**
   - Once changes are detected in your branch or as scheduled, Jenkins will automatically execute the Jenkins pipeline. The pipeline should include steps to run the services mentioned in the Docker Compose file. Ensure that the Docker Compose file is correctly configured to use pre-uploaded Docker images from Docker Hub.

3. **Check for Docker Image Existence:**
   - During the execution of the pipeline, make sure to add a check for the existence of the Docker images for the frontend and backend services on Docker Hub. This ensures that the pipeline only proceeds if the required images are available.

4. **Monitor the Jenkins Build:**
   - Monitor the Jenkins build console output for any errors or issues. It will show the progress and completion of the pipeline.
